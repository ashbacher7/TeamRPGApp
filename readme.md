Mad Scientist Syndrome RPG
=======

## Introduction
This is an RPG game created by Andrew Ashbacher, Chancellor Banchi, Blake Bicknell, and Tianzhuo Ren.

The game world outlook is based on near future, where humans gradually step in a cyber punk generation. 

You are a scientist, recently recruited by the organization SWD.

You have been tasked with developing a new technology for the company.

You personally think you are creating a new technology for the betterment of mankind.

During the game flow, every choice you make will decide how it ends.

Will you have a good ending? 

A bad ending? 

Or a selfish ending?

It’s all depending on your decision, now, make your choice.

## Key Features
Score system
* Hitting a button adds a value to a Globals.Score property. +1 for a bad choice, +2 for a selfish choice, +3 for a good choice.
* Once the last choice is selected, three if-statements are used to determine the end based on the value of Globals.Score
* The endings are determined as follows: 4 or less points is a bad ending, 5 to 7 points is a selfish ending, 8 or more is a good ending.

View End page
* Used global properties to hide the View End button, as well as each Ending within the View End page.
* Once an end page has been reached, the value synonymous to the page will change from false to true.
* This, in turn, changes the Button.IsVisible statement to true, revealing the button.
